## Usefulness

LinguaHelper is designed with efficiency and convenience in mind. The key aspects of its usefulness include:

- **Minimizing Interaction Time**: The software significantly reduces the time needed to switch between a language learning application and a web browser. It streamlines interactions with websites and simplifies data entry processes, allowing users to remain focused on their learning without the disruption of constantly switching contexts.

- **Detailed Learning History (In Development)**: We are working on a feature to store comprehensive learning histories complete with contextual information. This will enable learners to track their progress over time and revisit specific learning materials as needed.

- **Automated Data Gathering (In Development)**: Utilizing AI, LinguaHelper is being enhanced to automate the collection of data from web resources. This feature is especially beneficial for educational purposes, such as automatically generating annotations or comments in books or articles being studied.

- **Automated Text Commenting (In Development)**: Another exciting feature in the works is the AI-powered capability to automatically comment on texts. Whether it's a plain text file, PDF, or a DOCX document, this functionality aims to provide insightful, AI-generated commentary to assist in the learning and comprehension process.

These features and developments underscore our commitment to creating a tool that not only enhances language learning but also seamlessly integrates into the learner's workflow, thereby making the process more engaging and effective.

## Key Features

- **Web-Resource Automation**: By incorporating a chromium-based component, LinguaHelper automates interactions with web resources. It leverages custom Java Script APIs and JSON settings to provide a tailored browsing experience for language studies.
